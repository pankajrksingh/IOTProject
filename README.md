# IOTProject
IOT Project for course 273

1. Our IoT Application for detection of concentration of gas is aimed towards analysing gas concentration in a given air sample. 
2. The main goal of this application is to provide statistics of concentration count in the air and based on our statistics notify the users of the effects of increase or decrease for the gas percentage . 
3. We have implemented analysis of this statistics through various graphical representations. 
4. We also aim to provide solutions as to what steps can be taken in future based on the readings.
5. We made use of Arduino board with Wifi Shield present on it and then with the help of sensors analysed the different components such as Temperature, Humidity, CO2, NH3 using different sensors. 
6. The entire application is configured  and deployed on IBM Bluemix . We have used various Boilerplates and other services that were available on the platform to configure and use our application. We have used Arduino as the Board and have mounted sensors on it which were used for detection of the gases. Using IoT Boilerplate after specifying our MAC Address we were able to connect Arduino and then use sensors mounted on it to get our data. 
7. We have used DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensors and MQ135 Sensor for detecting gases in the atmosphere
